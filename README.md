### Structure

## **Existing Features**

### **Navigation:**

1. Every page has a simple yet effection Navigation bar that is transparent but transitions to black on the scroll of the page to stop content overlap.

![Navigation](assets/images/readme/nav-image.png "Navigation")

2. The navigation bar is also responsive and collapses on smaller screen sizes into a "burger" menu to keep the design clean and simple.

3. I implemented a hover effect when the user highlights a menu item to give the navigation menu an interactive feel.

4. I also added an orange background to the "contact us" menu item to divert the user's attention to the contact page. On smaller screens where the menu collapses, I added an alert above the navbar to have the same desired outcome.

### **Header:**

1. Every page has a consistent header with an H1 element and a background image.

### **Body:**

1. Every page follows the same content structure:
    
    - The website's text containers have an RGBA transparent background which helps the text stand out from the background image giving a clear contrast and making the text easy to read.
    - Each section of the content is clearly defined with a new heading making the flow of information easy to follow.
    - Each page divides the text with either images or videos to keep the user's attention for longer. 

### **Footer:**

1. Every page has the same styled footer:



### **index.html *"Page"*:**


## **Future Iterations**

**My Collection *"Page"*:**

- Gives users an easy way to track what cards they already own in their collection.
- Allows users to identify which cards they need to complete their collection.
- Allows user to estimate the value of their collection.

### Surface

## **Typography**

-   In this project I used the Exo font for titles and headings and Poppins for the main text, I also set a fallback font of sans-serif for cross-browser compatibility.
